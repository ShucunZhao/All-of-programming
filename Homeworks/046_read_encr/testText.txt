Happiness is difficult to define because it means something different to each individual person. 
Nobody can fully understand or experience another person's feelings,and we all have our own 
particular passions from which we take pleasure.Some people,for example,derive a sense of satisfaction
 from earning money or achieving success,whereas for others,health and family are much more important.
At the same time,a range of other feelings,from excitement to peacefulness,may be associated with the
idea of happiness,and the same person may therefore feel happy in a variety of different ways.
